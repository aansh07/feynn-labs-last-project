# AI Product Service Prototype Development and Business/Financial Modelling

Welcome to the repository for the AI Product Service Prototype Development and Business/Financial Modelling project. This project outlines a structured approach to developing an AI-based product or service, specifically focusing on predicting real estate prices using machine learning. 

## Project Overview

This project involves four key steps:
1. **Prototype Selection**
2. **Prototype Development**
3. **Business Modelling**
4. **Financial Modelling**

### Step 1: Prototype Selection

The initial phase is selecting a viable prototype idea based on:

- **Feasibility**: The product must be achievable within 2-3 years using current or emerging technologies. For example, predicting real estate prices using machine learning models is feasible given existing advancements.
  
- **Viability**: The product should address market needs and be sustainable for 20-30 years, adapting to future trends. Real estate price prediction fits this criterion due to increasing data availability and ongoing demand.
  
- **Monetization**: The prototype must have a clear revenue model. A subscription-based service for real estate analysis or data licensing are potential revenue streams.

### Step 2: Prototype Development

For the prototype, we developed a small-scale implementation using the Boston Housing dataset to build a machine learning model for predicting housing prices. 

- **Dataset**: Boston Housing dataset
- **Features**: RM (average number of rooms), LSTAT (percentage of lower status of the population), PTRATIO (pupil-teacher ratio)
- **Target**: Price (Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's)

**Implementation**:
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

# Feature selection
X = df[['PTRATIO']]  
y = df['Price']

# Splitting the dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Model training
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Model evaluation
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
```

The model evaluates housing prices based on the PTRATIO feature, with Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) metrics indicating performance.

### Step 3: Business Modelling

With the prototype validated, the next step is to create a business model:

- **Value Proposition**: Accurate real estate pricing insights for agents, buyers, and investors.
- **Customer Segments**: Real estate agents, investors, homebuyers, financial institutions.
- **Revenue Streams**: Subscription fees, customized prediction services, data licensing.
- **Key Resources**: Large datasets, machine learning models, cloud infrastructure.
- **Channels**: Online platforms, partnerships with real estate firms.
- **Cost Structure**: Data acquisition, model development, cloud storage.

### Step 4: Financial Modelling

The final step is designing a financial model using data analysis and machine learning.

- **Market Identification**: Real estate sector focusing on housing price predictions.
- **Data Analysis & Forecasting**:
  ```python
  # Forecasting future prices
  years = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]).reshape(-1, 1)
  future_prices = model.predict(years)

  # Financial Model Equation
  m = model.coef_[0]
  c = model.intercept_
  print(f'Financial Model Equation: y = {m:.2f}x + {c:.2f}')
  ```

  The financial model equation is:
  \[ \text{Price} = m \times (\text{Year}) + c \]
  
  where \( m \) is the growth rate and \( c \) is the base cost. This model helps in forecasting future revenue based on predicted trends.

## Conclusion

This project outlines a comprehensive approach to developing an AI product, from selecting and validating a prototype to creating a robust business and financial model. The successful implementation of the linear regression model on the Boston Housing dataset demonstrates the feasibility of price prediction. The business model ensures long-term sustainability, while the financial model provides a clear roadmap for future growth.
